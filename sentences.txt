We all know that typing speed matters. 
Whether you’re applying for a job as a paralegal or an executive assistant, being able to type quickly and accurately might be the only skill that stands between you and another equally qualified applicant.
Can you type 65+ words per minute? If you didn’t have the benefit of taking a typing course or two in school, that might not be the case. 
So, how do you get those skills up to par in a short period of time so that you can compete for these high paying positions?
We don’t guarantee overnight results but, with practice you’ll definitely get a leg up on the competition.
